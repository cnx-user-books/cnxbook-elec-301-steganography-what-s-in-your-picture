<title>Bit-o-steg detection</title>
<para id="id49233318">Due to the complexity of bit-o-steg, we
turned to previous research to find a viable detection method. Each
entry in the 8x8 blocks has a specific probability distribution.
The distribution is found by looking at the values of that entry
slot across the entire image. Figure 1 shows a histogram of an
entry without data. The histogram looks at the DCT coefficient
value and counts how often that value appears within that entry
slot. Figure 2 shows a histogram of an entry with data. Comparing
the two figures, there is a sudden drop around the 0 value in the
histogram of an entry with data. The histogram of an entry with
data also appears to smooth out.</para>
<para id="id49513104">These distributions are defined by their own
characteristic functions. The bit-o-steg hiding distorts that
distribution by randomly changes certain entries thus altering the
function. Using the inner product, we could test for a match
between the characteristic function and the suspect imageâ€™s
probability distribution. Unfortunately, the distribution functions
vary based on the subject of the picture. Furthermore, we lack the
statistical background necessary to classify these distributions
and properly identify the characteristic functions. Thus,
implementing bit-o-steg detection proved to be beyond the scope of
this project.</para>
